# Pixelpex
 A multiplayer game to draw pixel art in an infinite map =]

 I'm still working on it, but you can already try it out at [Pixelpex](https://thepixelpex.web.app) =D

 I will be writting a better README once this project is ready enough (Since I'll probably never stop updating because I like to add cool useful features).

Hope you like it ðŸ‘€
